# HZ asset block explorer page
The [HZ blockexplorer](https://explorer.horizonplatform.io) ([orig source](https://github.com/pharesim/hz-blockexplorer)) was lacking a dedicated page for each asset, so I forked it into https://github.com/altsheets/hz-blockexplorer, and added that function - after [learning PHP](https://twitter.com/altsheets/status/615379388679483392) for it. But I am a total PHP newbie, so please check my code, then pull it upstream.

Main aspects:
* table with all properties from getAsset
* if issuer 'account' has an 'alias', show it
* 'quantity' derived from 'quantityQNT' and 'decimals'
* hyperlink to the transaction in which the asset was issued (for date, etc.)
* use of colors for fast grokking

Made sense so I built it:
* 'numberOfTransfers' and numberOfAccounts' already implemented, for future HZ version.
* if 'asset id' is unknown, hide most of the table, only show the error message. 
* specific assets can display different warnings (see below).

Explanations:
* on the right hand side, I am giving the most essential instructions for newbies
* warning about non-uniqueness of asset 'name'
* quick link to wallet (online / local)
* how to add the 'asset id' to the wallet
* links to external information: Videos, and long text "how to buy HZ, and how to buy a HZ asset - for newbies"

## examples

These are working examples of the new function, proudly presenting my asset "AAssetHZ":

* web page: proper asset http://188.226.155.38:8080/hzbe/?page=asset&id=8101260088962758269
* web page: wrong asset id http://188.226.155.38:8080/hzbe/?page=asset&id=0
* json api: proper asset http://188.226.155.38:8080/hzbe/api.php?page=asset&id=8101260088962758269

Great, isn't it?

## warnings
Some assets are known to be **test assets**, or **revoked**, or even **scams** (perhaps, probably or proven scams). 

However, the (too) centralized power of the only official block explorer ... needs a balance between user and issuer protection (censorship is bad)!  

So *all assets are still shown* - but in some cases with a clear warning.

All is hardcoded into an XML file. I urge the team to always link back to a forum post where detailed explanations are given, and can be discussed - so that e.g. the issuer gets a chance to react to the suspicion.  

examples:
* test asset http://188.226.155.38:8080/hzbe/?page=asset&id=5903523947573024709 clearly intended to be only a test
* revoked asset  http://188.226.155.38:8080/hzbe/?page=asset&id=16661902544444460183 revoked by the issuer
* perhaps scam http://188.226.155.38:8080/hzbe/?page=asset&id=3 there must be a heavy suspicion before using this!
* probably scam http://188.226.155.38:8080/hzbe/?page=asset&id=4 almost sure, not many doubts left. 
* proven scam http://188.226.155.38:8080/hzbe/?page=asset&id=5 definitely no doubts.

In case he team decides to drop those warnings completely, the easiest way is to keep all code, but just delete the XML child nodes from data/assetwarnings.xml . If they are kept and extended, and that file ever gets large ... it might make sense to load it only once and keep it in memory, instead of for each call (like now). See the comments in my code. 

## affected files
In comparison to the [original block explorer](https://github.com/pharesim/hz-blockexplorer) I have changed or added at least these files [in my fork](https://github.com/altsheets/hz-blockexplorer): 

* assetsReadme.md (this readme here)
* todo.txt (some problems in the existing code that I noticed)
* prepareServer.sh (very useful if you want to install this to your own server!)
* classes
  * classes/controller.php
  * classes/model.php
* config/config.php
* views/templates
  * views/templates/asset.phtml
  * views/templates/altsheetsCredits.html
* views/api
  * views/api/templates/asset.phtml
  * views/api/templates/home.phtml
* views/cli/templates/asset.phtml (untested, I did not know how)
* data/assetwarnings.xml (hardcoded warnings for certain assets)

... perhaps even more. Check the commits on https://github.com/altsheets/hz-blockexplorer .

## my first big commit went strange - manual diff needed
My main changes & additions to pharesim's original source code were commited here: https://github.com/altsheets/hz-blockexplorer/commit/7b15ade59030c3c04cc60c8e4ce95e3d366c0aac and when you look at it, the github 'diff' view pretends that ALL lines have been changed - which is wrong, I changed only a tiny fraction. It perhaps came about when I transferred the files between Windows & Linux?

To see my real changes, you need to use your own 'diff' tools now, either by cloning my repo here to another folder on your disk and using diff locally, or by using e.g. this online service:

http://www.diffnow.com/ --> URLs
1st URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pharesim/hz-blockexplorer/master/classes/model.php
2nd URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/altsheets/hz-blockexplorer/master/classes/model.php

Then you see that I only made changes after lines 311 and 449.

Sorry for that hassle. In the future I will sync machines only by push/pull through github, not by FTP anymore. 
 
 
## license
Please pull upstream into the official block explorer - that's why I have built it.

But please (a) keep my credits in there: 

    The blockexplorer asset function was contributed by AltSheetsDev 
    (who is not funded like the HZ core team), and is placed under 
    my 'giveback license v04' (http://altsheets.ddns.net/give).
    Click for how to support me - or simply send some HZ 
    to NHZ-Q675-SGBG-LQ43-D38L6 now. Thanks.

and (b) consider to send me a big bounty for this work.

Thanks a lot.

    your happy AltSheetsDev on June 29th, 2015
       

### temporary notes
When this is pulled upstream, replace all above 188.226.155.38:8080 with the official HZ blockexplorer domain. Then delete this note.
